Deadsimple desktop application skeleton using only bash,nc and a webbrowser

### Why is this handy ###

Well for rapid desktop application development.
Instead of fiddling with gui toolkits, c/c++, or with webservers, you can just use this
shellscript which serves htmlfiles to your local browser.

### Dependancies ###

There are little dependancies, best is to have a linux system:

* a linux system bash (99% this is the case)
* nc (99% this is the case)
* browser

In theory this could also work on windows using cygwin or a standalone bash-binary.
